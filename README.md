# Multi-Label Classification of Thoracic Diseases

This project applies deep learning for multi-label classification of thoracic diseases using the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, PyTorch
- DenseNet-121 architecture
- Pandas, NumPy

## Task Summary
- Preprocessed 112,000+ chest X-ray images
- Applied image resizing, normalization, and one-hot label encoding
- Modified DenseNet-121 to suit multi-label output
- Used weighted binary cross-entropy for class imbalance

## Results
- Achieved ~61% test accuracy
- Real-world impact in medical image classification

## Skills Applied
